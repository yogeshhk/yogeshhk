## I:
- 🌱 Create free educational content about Python, Machine/Deep Learning, etc. and open-source it under 'TeachingDataScience' repository [here](https://github.com/yogeshhk/TeachingDataScience).
- 👯 Counsel for Mid-career transition to Data Science. My own transition is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQzWosVzkM4) and here is my [TEDX talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VbWRs7BsPY) on this topic. General Learning Path for such transition is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_8i6IQz8l8).
- 💬 Run office hours for any technical or career coaching queries, on Saturdays 2 to 5 pm (India time). Feel free to send email for appointment to my firstnamelastname at yahoo dot com . More details [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6913670687291240448/) and [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7147062487174070272/)
- 📫 Post on LinkedIn regarding AI-ML and allied topics. I would be very happy if you [follow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogeshkulkarni/) me there. 😊
- ⚡ Publish my blogs-stories on Medium as well. Feel free to follow me [here](https://yogeshharibhaukulkarni.medium.com/).

### Role
Position as a coach, an advisor and a thought leader in a pioneering a transformative approach to strategic innovation through a **MicroSaaS** methodology focused on unlocking hidden potential. **Not Looking for Success but for Wonder!!**

### Prominent Domain: Graphs with AI

Graphs are everywhere—social networks, molecular structures, geometric shapes, and more. But what happens when we take graphs a step further? **Knowledge Graphs** bring us even closer to modeling reality, unlocking new AI possibilities. 🚀  

Here's what I'm currently exploring in this space:  
✅ **Graph RAG** – Retrieving relational contexts beyond similarity, building a [chatbot](https://github.com/yogeshhk/Sarvadnya/tree/master/src/ask_yogasutra) on Indic wisdom 📜🤖 
✅ **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** – Learning embeddings for predictions/classifications, a consulting project, presentations [here](https://github.com/yogeshhk/TeachingDataScience)  
✅ **Geometric Deep Learning** – Developing invariant representations for tasks like dimensionality reduction - [MidcurveNN](https://github.com/yogeshhk/MidcurveNN)  
✅ **Graph-based Agents** – Automating workflows with intelligent agents, potential MicroSaaS idea 💡, that's [here](https://github.com/yogeshhk/MicroSaaS/tree/master/src/qa_agent)  


Thank you 🙏
