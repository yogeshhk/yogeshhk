### Prominent Domain: Graphs with AI

Graphs are everywhere—social networks, molecular structures, geometric shapes, and more. But what happens when we take graphs a step further? **Knowledge Graphs** bring us even closer to modeling reality, unlocking new AI possibilities. 🚀  

Here's what I'm currently exploring in this space:  
✅ **Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** – Retrieving relational contexts beyond similarity, building a [chatbot](https://github.com/yogeshhk/Sarvadnya/tree/master/src/ask_yogasutra) on Indic wisdom 📜🤖 
✅ **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** – Developing invariant representations for tasks like dimensionality reduction - [MidcurveNN](https://github.com/yogeshhk/MidcurveNN)
✅ **Graph-based Agents** – Automating workflows with intelligent agents, potential MicroSaaS idea 💡, that's [here](https://github.com/yogeshhk/Sarvadnya/tree/master/src/qa_automation_langchain)  


Thank you 🙏
