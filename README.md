## I am involved in:

### 🤖 AI Advisory Services
I run an Artificial Intelligence (AI) advisory service in the following modes:

* **Consultancy**: Helping organizations in the evolving AI landscape. 👉 More details (including commercials) [here](./domains/Notes_AIAdvisory.md)
* **Training**: Helping individuals stay current with AI, ML, NLP, etc.  👉 More details (including commercials) [here](./domains/Notes_AITraining.md). The educational content used in training, covering Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc., has been open-sourced in the [`TeachingDataScience`](https://github.com/yogeshhk/TeachingDataScience) repository.

### 🔬 Research and Collaboration
I actively engage in personal research and collaborations with academic and industry partners on topics such as:

* ✅ **Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
  Retrieving relational contexts beyond simple similarity; [Ask Yogasutra](https://github.com/yogeshhk/Sarvadnya/tree/master/src/ask_yogasutra).
* ✅ **Geometric Deep Learning**
  Creating invariant representations for tasks like dimensionality reduction, see [MidcurveNN](https://github.com/yogeshhk/MidcurveNN)
* ✅ **Indic Generative AI**
  RAG and Fine-tuning using Marathi data 💡, see [Ask Vichar-Chitre](https://github.com/yogeshhk/Sarvadnya/tree/master/src/ask_vichar-chitre)

### 🙌 Social Contributions (Pro Bono)
I strongly believe in giving back to society and raising public awareness about AI through:

* 👯 **Mid-Career Transition Counseling (to Data Science)**. My own transition story: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQzWosVzkM4) | [TEDx Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VbWRs7BsPY). General learning path: [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_8i6IQz8l8)
