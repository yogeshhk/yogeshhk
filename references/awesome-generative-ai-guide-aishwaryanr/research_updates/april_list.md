While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. The main obstacle to training LLMs directly over neurally compressed text is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs not well-suited for learning. To address this, the paper proposes Equal-Info Windows, a compression technique segmenting text into blocks that compress to the same bit length. This method enables effective learning over neurally compressed text, improving with scale and outperforming byte-level baselines on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. The paper also provides suggestions for further improving high-compression tokenizers.                                                                                                                       | Model Compression               |

| April 3, 2024  | [On the Scalability of Diffusion-based Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02883)                                                | This paper empirically studies the scaling properties of diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models by conducting extensive ablations on scaling denoising backbones and training sets. The study explores various training settings and training costs to understand how to efficiently scale the model for better performance at reduced cost. The findings suggest that increasing the transformer blocks is more parameter-efficient for improving text-image alignment than increasing channel numbers. Additionally, the quality and diversity of the training set have a significant impact on text-image alignment performance and learning efficiency. Scaling functions are provided to predict text-image alignment performance based on model size, compute, and dataset size.                                                                                                                                                              | Multimodal LLMs                 |
| April 2, 2024  | [Direct Preference Optimization of Video Large Multimodal Models from Language Model Reward](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01258)                    | This paper introduces a novel framework for aligning large multimodal models (LMMs) with video content using detailed video captions as a proxy. The framework enhances the performance of video LMMs on video Question Answering (QA) tasks by incorporating informative feedback and improving the accuracy of generated responses compared to corresponding videos. The approach utilizes direct preference optimization (DPO) to guide LMMs towards generating more accurate, helpful, and harmless content in multimodal contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Multimodal LLMs                 |

Finetuned from Mistral-7B and CodeLlama-70B, EURUS models achieve state-of-the-art results among open-source models on a diverse set of benchmarks covering mathematics, code generation, and logical reasoning problems. EURUS outperforms existing open-source models by margins more than 13.3% on challenging benchmarks like LeetCode and TheoremQA. The strong performance of EURUS is attributed to ULTRA INTERACT, a large-scale alignment dataset designed for complex reasoning tasks, and a novel reward modeling objective derived from preference learning techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Domain-Specific LLMs            |

By capping the number of tokens participating in computations at each layer, the method uses a static computation graph with fluid token identities, resulting in efficient compute allocation. Models trained with this method match baseline performance but require fewer FLOPs per forward pass, speeding up training and sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | New Architecture                |
| April 1, 2024  | [LLaVA-Gemma: Accelerating Multimodal Foundation Models with a Compact Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01331)                          | This paper presents LLaVA-Gemma, a suite of multimodal foundation models trained using the LLaVA framework with the Gemma family of LLMs, particularly the 2B parameter Gemma model. The study evaluates the effect of ablating three design features: pretraining the connector, utilizing a more powerful image backbone, and increasing the size of the language backbone. While LLaVA-Gemma exhibits moderate performance on various evaluations, it fails to surpass current state-of-the-art models of comparable size. The paper releases training recipes, code, and weights for the LLaVA-Gemma models, facilitating further research in this area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Multimodal LLMs                 |
