Through an extensive analysis across five open-domain question answering benchmarks, the authors identify instances where retrieval augmentation actually hampers model performance. To combat this, they introduce two strategies: first, a baseline approach using a natural language inference model to filter out passages that don't support the question-answer pairs, ensuring the model isn't misled by irrelevant data. While effective in reducing inaccuracies, this method risks excluding useful information. To refine this approach, the authors develop a technique for enhancing the language model's ability to discern and appropriately use retrieved passages, by training with a combination of relevant and irrelevant contexts. Remarkably, they demonstrate that a modest dataset of just 1,000 examples can significantly improve the model's resilience to irrelevant information without compromising its performance on pertinent examples. | RAG Enhanced LLMs | October 2023 |
