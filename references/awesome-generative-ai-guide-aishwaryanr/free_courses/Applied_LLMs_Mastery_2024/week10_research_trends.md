## ETMI5: Explain to Me in 5

Within this segment of our course, we will delve into the latest research developments surrounding LLMs. Kicking off with an examination of MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs), we'll explore how this particular area is advancing swiftly. Following that, our discussion will extend to popular open-source models, focusing on their construction and contributions. Subsequently, we'll tackle the concept of agents that possess the capability to carry out tasks autonomously from inception to completion. Additionally, we'll understand the role of domain-specific models in enriching specialized knowledge across various sectors and take a closer look at groundbreaking architectures such as the Mixture of Experts and RWKV, which are set to improve the scalability and efficiency of LLMs. 

## Multimodal LLMs (MM-LLMs)

In the past year, there have been notable advancements in MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs). Specifically, MM-LLMs represent a significant evolution in the space of language models, as they incorporate multimodal components alongside their text processing capabilities. While progress has also been made in multimodal models in general, MM-LLMs have experienced particularly substantial improvements, largely due to the remarkable enhancements in LLMs over the year, upon which they heavily rely.

Moreover, the development of MM-LLMs has been greatly aided by the adoption of cost-effective training strategies. These strategies have enabled these models to efficiently manage inputs and outputs across multiple modalities. Unlike conventional models, MM-LLMs not only retain the impressive reasoning and decision-making capabilities inherent in Large Language Models but also expand their utility to address a diverse array of tasks spanning various modalities.

To understand how MM-LLMs function, we can go over some common architectural components. Most MM-LLMs can be divided in 5 main components as shown in the image below. The components explained below are adapted from the paper “[MM-LLMs: Recent Advances in MultiModal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13601.pdf)”. Let’s understand each of the components in detail.

**1. Modality Encoder:** The Modality Encoder (ME) plays a pivotal role in encoding inputs from diverse modalities $I_X$ to extract corresponding features  $F_X$  Various pre-trained encoder options exist for different modalities, including visual, audio, and 3D inputs. For visual inputs, options like NFNet-F6, ViT, CLIP ViT, and Eva-CLIP ViT are commonly employed. Similarly, for audio inputs, frameworks such as CFormer, HuBERT, BEATs, and Whisper are utilized. Point cloud inputs are encoded using ULIP-2 with a PointBERT backbone. Some MM-LLMs leverage ImageBind, a unified encoder covering multiple modalities, including image, video, text, audio, and heat maps.

**2. Input Projector:** The Input Projector $Θ_(X→T)$ aligns the encoded features of other modalities $F_X$ with the text feature space $T$. This alignment is crucial for effectively integrating multimodal information into the LLM Backbone. The Input Projector can be implemented through various methods such as Linear Projectors, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Cross-attention, Q-Former, or P-Former, each with its unique approach to aligning features across modalities.

**3. LLM Backbone:** The LLM Backbone serves as the core agent in MM-LLMs, inheriting notable properties from LLMs such as zero-shot generalization, few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and instruction following. The backbone processes representations from various modalities, engaging in semantic understanding, reasoning, and decision-making regarding the inputs. Additionally, some MM-LLMs incorporate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Prefix-tuning, Adapter, or LoRA to minimize the number of additional trainable parameters.

**4. Output Projector:** The Output Projector $Θ_(T→X)$ maps signal token representations $S_X$from the LLM Backbone into features $H_X$ understandable to the Modality Generator $MG_X$. This projection facilitates the generation of multimodal content. The Output Projector is typically implemented using a Tiny Transformer or MLP, and its optimization focuses on minimizing the distance between the mapped features $H_X$ and the conditional text representations of $MG_X$ .

**5. Modality Generator:** The Modality Generator $MG_X$ is responsible for producing outputs in distinct modalities such as images, videos, or audio. Commonly, existing works leverage off-the-shelf Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for image, video, and audio synthesis. During training, ground truth content is transformed into latent features, which are then de-noised to generate multimodal content using LDMs conditioned on the mapped features $H_X$ from the Output Projector.

### Training

MM-LLMs are trained in two main stages: MultiModal Pre-Training (MM PT) and MultiModal Instruction-Tuning (MM IT).

**MM PT:**
During MM PT, MM-LLMs are trained to understand and generate content from different types of data like images, videos, and text. They learn to align these different kinds of information to work together. For example, they learn to associate a picture of a cat with the word "cat" and vice versa. This stage focuses on teaching the model to handle different types of input and output.

**MM IT:**
In MM IT, the model is fine-tuned based on specific instructions. This helps the model adapt to new tasks and perform better on them. There are two main methods used in MM IT:

- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):** The model is trained on examples that are structured in a way that includes instructions. For instance, in a question-answer task, each question is paired with the correct answer. This helps the model learn to follow instructions and generate appropriate responses.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** The model receives feedback on its responses, usually in the form of human-generated feedback. This feedback helps the model improve its performance over time by learning from its mistakes.

Therefore MM-LLMs are trained to understand and generate content from multiple sources of information, and they can be fine-tuned to perform specific tasks better based on instructions and feedback.

The below diagram summarizes popular MM-LLMs and models used for each of their components.

## Agents

LLM Agents have been gaining significant momentum in recent months and represent the future and expansion of LLM capabilities. An LLM agent is an AI system that employs a large language model at its core to perform a wide range of tasks, not limited to text generation. These tasks include conducting conversations, reasoning, completing various tasks, and exhibiting autonomous behaviors based on the context and instructions provided. LLM agents operate through sophisticated prompt engineering, where instructions, context, and permissions are encoded to guide the agent's actions and responses.

### **Capabilities of LLM Agents**

- **Autonomy**: LLM agents can operate with varying degrees of autonomy, from reactive to proactive behaviors, based on their design and the prompts they receive.
- **Task Completion**: With access to external knowledge bases, tools, and reasoning capabilities, LLM agents can assist in or independently handle a variety of applications, from chatbots to complex workflow automation.
- **Adaptability**: Their language modeling strength allows them to understand and follow natural language prompts, making them versatile and capable of customizing their responses and actions.
- **Advanced Skills**: Through prompt engineering, LLM agents can be equipped with advanced analytical, planning, and execution skills. They can manage tasks with minimal human intervention, relying on their ability to access and process information.
- **Collaboration**: They enable seamless collaboration between humans and AI by responding to interactive prompts and integrating feedback into their operations.

LLM agents combine the core language processing capabilities of LLMs with additional modules like planning, memory, and tool usage, effectively becoming the "brain" that directs a series of operations to fulfill tasks or respond to queries. This architecture allows them to break down complex questions into manageable parts, retrieve and analyze relevant information, and generate comprehensive responses or visual representations as needed.

Example:

Suppose we're interested in organizing an international conference on sustainable energy solutions, aiming to cover topics such as renewable energy technologies, sustainability practices in energy production, and innovative policies for promoting green energy. The task involves complex planning and information gathering, including identifying key speakers, understanding current trends in sustainable energy, and engaging with stakeholders.

To tackle this multifaceted project, an LLM agent could be employed to:

1. **Research and Summarization**: Break down the task into sub-tasks such as identifying emerging trends in sustainable energy, locating leading experts in the field, and summarizing recent research findings. The agent would use its access to a vast range of digital resources to compile comprehensive reports.
2. **Speaker Engagement**: Draft personalized invitations to potential speakers, incorporating details about the conference's aims and how their expertise aligns with its goals. The agent can generate these communications based on profiles and previous works of the experts.
3. **Logistics Planning**: Create a detailed plan for the conference, including a timeline of activities leading up to the event, a checklist for logistical arrangements (venue, virtual platform setup for hybrid participation, etc.), and a strategy for participant engagement. The agent can outline these plans by accessing databases of event planning resources and best practices.
4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Draft updates and newsletters for stakeholders, providing insights into the conference's progress, highlights of the agenda, and key speakers confirmed. The agent tailors each communication piece to its audience, whether it's sponsors, participants, or the general public.
5. **Interactive Q&A Session Planning**: Develop a framework for an interactive Q&A session, including pre-gathering questions from potential attendees, categorizing them, and preparing briefing documents for speakers. The agent can facilitate this by analyzing registration data and submitted queries.

In this scenario, the LLM agent not only aids in the execution of complex and time-consuming tasks but also ensures that the planning process is thorough, informed by the latest developments in sustainable energy, and tailored to the specific goals of the conference. By leveraging external databases, tools for data analysis and visualization, and its innate language processing capabilities, the LLM agent acts as a comprehensive assistant, streamlining the organization of a large-scale event with numerous moving parts.

The framework for LLM agents can be conceptualized through various lenses, and one such perspective is offered by the paper “[A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11432.pdf)”, through its distinctive components.  This architecture is composed of four key modules: the Profiling Module, Memory Module, Planning Module, and Action Module. Each of these modules plays a crucial role in enabling the LLM agent to act autonomously and effectively in various scenarios.

Image Source : [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11432.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11432.pdf)

### **Components of LLM Agents**

1. **Profiling Module** 

The Profiling Module is responsible for defining the agent's identity and role. It incorporates information such as age, gender, career, personality traits, and social relationships to shape the agent's behavior. This module uses various methods to create profiles, including handcrafting for precise control, LLM-generation for scalability, and dataset alignment for real-world accuracy. The agent's profile significantly influences its interactions, decision-making processes, and the way it executes tasks, making this module foundational to the agent's design.

**2. Memory Module**

The Memory Module stores information the agent perceives from its environment and uses this stored knowledge to inform future actions. It mimics human memory processes, with structures inspired by sensory, short-term, and long-term memory. This module enables the agent to accumulate experiences, evolve based on past interactions, and behave in a consistent and effective manner. It ensures that the agent can recall past behaviors, learn from them, and adapt its strategies over time.

**3. Planning Module**

The Planning Module empowers the agent with the ability to decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks and address them individually, mirroring human problem-solving strategies. It includes planning both with and without feedback, allowing for flexible adaptation to changing environments and requirements. Strategies such as single-path reasoning and Chain of Thought (CoT) are used to guide the agent in a step-by-step manner towards achieving its goals, making the planning process critical for the agent's effectiveness and reliability.

**4. Action Module**

The Action Module translates the agent's decisions into specific outcomes, directly interacting with the environment. It considers the goals of the actions, how actions are generated, the range of possible actions (action space), and the consequences of these actions. This module integrates inputs from the profiling, memory, and planning modules to execute decisions that align with the agent's objectives and capabilities. It is essential for the practical application of the agent's strategies, enabling it to produce tangible results in the real world.

Together, these modules form a comprehensive framework for LLM agent architecture, allowing for the creation of agents that can assume specific roles, perceive and learn from their environment, and autonomously execute tasks with a degree of sophistication and flexibility that mimics human behavior.

### Future Research Directions

1. Most LLM Agent research has been confined to text-based interactions. Expanding into multi-modal environments, where agents can process and generate outputs across various formats like images, audio, and video, introduces complexities in data processing and requires agents to interpret and respond to a broader range of sensory inputs.
2. Hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect text, becomes more problematic in LLM agent systems due to the potential for cascading misinformation. Developing strategies to detect and mitigate hallucinations involves managing information flow to prevent inaccuracies from spreading across the network.
3. While LLM agents learn from instant feedback, creating reliable interactive environments for scalable learning poses challenges. Furthermore, current methods focus on adjusting agents individually, not fully leveraging the collective intelligence that could emerge from coordinated interactions among multiple agents.
4. Scaling the number of agents (multi-agent systems) for a use-case raises significant computational demands and complexities in coordination and communication among agents. Developing efficient orchestration methodologies is essential for optimizing workflows and ensuring effective multi-agent cooperation.
5. Current benchmarks may not adequately capture the emergent behaviors critical to agents or span across diverse research domains. Developing comprehensive benchmarks is crucial for assessing agents’ capabilities in various fields, including science, economics, and healthcare.

## Domain Specific LLMs

While general LLMs are versatile and perform well on a broad range of tasks, they often fall short when it comes to handling specialized or niche tasks due to a lack of training on domain-specific data. Additionally, running these generic models can be costly. In these scenarios, domain-specific LLMs emerge as a superior alternative. Their training is focused on data from specific fields, which enhances their accuracy and provides them with a deeper understanding of the relevant terminology and concepts. This tailored approach not only improves their performance on tasks specific to a certain domain but also minimizes the chances of generating irrelevant or incorrect information. 

Designed to adhere to the regulatory and ethical standards of their respective domains, these models ensure the appropriate handling of sensitive data. They also communicate more effectively with domain experts, thanks to their command of professional language. From an economic standpoint, domain-specific LLMs offer more efficient solutions by eliminating the need for significant manual adjustments. Furthermore, their specialized knowledge base enables the identification of unique insights and patterns, driving innovation in their respective fields.

4. With growing awareness of AI's societal impact, the development of domain-specific LLMs will likely emphasize ethical considerations, fairness, and transparency, particularly in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance.

## New LLM Architectures

### Mixture of Experts

Mixture of Experts (MoEs) represents a sophisticated architecture within the realm of transformer models, focusing on enhancing model scalability and computational efficiency. Here's a breakdown of what MoEs are and their significance:

**Definition and Components**

- **MoEs in Transformers**: In transformer models, MoEs replace traditional dense feed-forward network (FFN) layers with sparse MoE layers. These layers comprise a number of "experts," each being a neural network—typically FFNs, but potentially more complex structures or even hierarchical MoEs.
- **Experts**: These are specialized neural networks (often FFNs) that handle specific portions of the data. An MoE layer may contain several experts, such as 8, allowing for a diverse range of data processing capabilities within the same model layer.
- **Gate Network/Router**: This is a critical component that directs input tokens to the appropriate experts based on learned parameters. The router decides, for instance, which expert is best suited to process a given input token, thus enabling a dynamic allocation of computational resources.

**Advantages**

- **Efficient Pretraining**: By utilizing MoEs, models can be pretrained with significantly less computational resources, allowing for larger model or dataset scales within the same compute budget as a dense model.
- **Faster Inference**: Despite having a large number of parameters, MoEs only use a subset for inference, leading to quicker processing times compared to dense models with a similar parameter count. However, this efficiency comes with the caveat of high memory requirements due to the need to load all parameters into RAM.

**Challenges**

- **Training Generalization**: While MoEs are more compute-efficient during pretraining, they have historically faced challenges in generalizing well during fine-tuning, often leading to overfitting.
- **Memory Requirements**: The efficient inference process of MoEs requires substantial memory to load the entire model's parameters, even though only a fraction are actively used during any given inference task.

**Implementation Details**

- **Parameter Sharing**: Not all parameters in a MoE model are exclusive to individual experts. Many are shared across the model, contributing to its efficiency. For instance, in a MoE model like Mixtral 8x7B, the dense equivalent parameter count might be less than the sum total of all experts due to shared components.
- **Inference Speed**: The inference speed benefits stem from the model only engaging a subset of experts for each token, effectively reducing the computational load to that of a much smaller model, while maintaining the benefits of a large parameter space.

### Mamba Models

Mamba is an innovative recurrent neural network architecture that stands out for its efficiency in handling long sequences, potentially up to 1 million elements. This model has garnered attention for being a strong competitor to the well-known Transformer models due to its impressive scalability and faster processing capabilities. Here's a simplified overview of what Mamba is and why it's significant:

**Core Features of Mamba:**

- **Linear Time Processing**: Unlike Transformers, which suffer from computational and memory costs that scale quadratically with sequence length, Mamba operates in linear time. This makes it much more efficient, especially for very long sequences.
- **Selective State Spaces**: Mamba employs selective state spaces, allowing it to manage and process lengthy sequences effectively by focusing on relevant parts of the data at any given time.

Selective State Spaces (SSS) in the context of models like Mamba refer to a sophisticated approach in neural network architecture that enables the model to efficiently handle and process very long sequences of data. This approach is particularly designed to improve upon the limitations of traditional models like Transformers and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) when dealing with sequences of significant length. Here’s a breakdown of the key concepts behind Selective State Spaces:

**Basis of Selective State Spaces:**

- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: At the core, SSS builds upon the concept of State Space Models. SSMs are a class of models used for describing systems that evolve over time, capturing dynamics through state variables that change in response to external inputs. SSMs have been used in various fields, such as signal processing, control systems, and now, in sequence modeling for AI.
- **Selectivity Mechanism**: The "selective" aspect introduces a mechanism that allows the model to determine which parts of the input sequence are relevant at any given time. This is achieved through a gating or routing function that dynamically selects which state space (or subset of the model's parameters) should be activated based on the input. This selective activation helps the model to focus its computational resources on the most pertinent parts of the data, enhancing efficiency.

**Advantages Over Traditional Models:**

- **Efficiency with Long Sequences**: Mamba's architecture is optimized for speed, offering up to five times faster throughput than Transformers while handling long sequences more effectively.
- **Versatility**: While its prowess is evident in text-based applications like chatbots and summarization, Mamba also shows potential in other areas requiring the analysis of long sequences, such as audio generation, genomics, and time series data.
- **Innovative Design**: The model builds on state space models (S4) but introduces a novel approach by incorporating selective structured state space sequence models, which enhance its processing capabilities.

Mamba represents a significant advancement in sequence modeling, offering a more efficient alternative to Transformers for tasks involving long sequences. Its ability to scale linearly with sequence length without a corresponding increase in computational and memory requirements makes it a promising tool for a wide range of applications beyond just natural language processing.

In essence, Mamba is redefining what's possible in AI sequence modeling, combining the best of RNNs and state space models with innovative techniques to achieve high efficiency and performance across various domains.
