# 3 Day RAG Roadmap: Understanding, Building and Evaluating RAG Systems 2024

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular application of LLMs recently, with significant progress made in just a few months. Its popularity stems from its lightweight nature and the ease with which it can be integrated with any LLM. To help you get acquainted with RAG, we have put together a 3-day learning plan.

This guide will introduce you to the fundamentals, show you how to develop applications, delve into advanced functionalities, and teach you how to assess RAG applications. Plan to spend about 2-3 hours each day on the provided materials.

Happy Learning!
