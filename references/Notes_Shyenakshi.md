## Introduction

Shyenakshi, meaning "Hawk-Eye" in Sanskrit, is a comprehensive toolkit for processing and analyzing aerial imagery. Our goal is to develop state-of-the-art algorithms and models that can extract valuable insights from top-view images, benefiting sectors such as agriculture, urban planning, defense, and environmental monitoring.

## Why Aerial Image Processing?

While Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements with large language models (LLMs), there remains a vast potential in image processing, particularly in aerial and satellite imagery. Shyenakshi aims to bridge this gap by focusing on:

1. **Building Useful Applications**: Developing tools that can benefit various sectors including agriculture, medicine, defense, and consultancy.
2. **Monetization Strategy**: Implementing a pay-per-use API model to generate passive income while providing value to users.
3. **Future-Proofing**: Starting with 2D image processing and gradually progressing to 3D models, lidar, and photogrammetry.

## Features

- Object detection and classification in aerial imagery
- Land use and land cover mapping
- Crop health assessment for precision agriculture
- Urban planning and infrastructure mapping
- Change detection for environmental monitoring
- Custom model training for specific use cases

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shyenakshi.git
cd shyenakshi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use Shyenakshi for object detection in an aerial image:

```python
from shyenakshi import ObjectDetector

detector = ObjectDetector()
image_path = "path/to/your/aerial/image.jpg"
results = detector.detect(image_path)

for obj in results:
    print(f"Detected {obj.label} with confidence {obj.confidence}")
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to our [documentation](link-to-documentation).

# Shyenakshi

Vision of a hawk. A repository for arial/top-view image processing algorithms-models such as from drones, UAVs etc.

## Why the Shift?
The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have transformed NLP, there is an exciting opportunity to pivot towards image processing, particularly in areas where LLMs have not fully dominated, such as image analysis.

## Plan
1. Build Something Useful: Focus on developing applications that can benefit sectors like agriculture, medicine, defense, and consultancy.
2. Monetization Strategy: Implement a pay-per-use API model to generate passive income.
3. Future Scope: Start with 2D image processing, gradually progressing to 3D models, lidar, and photogrammetry.

## Action Items
1. Education and Training:
   - Enroll in image processing and object detection courses on Udemy.
   - Follow relevant YouTube playlists.
   - Study agriculture drone image processing tutorials.
   - Participate in Kaggle competitions.
   - Learn PyTorch for image processing and Ludwig for image fine-tuning.
2. Content Creation:
   - Prepare short demos and tutorials.
   - Publish articles on Medium.
   - Share insights and updates on LinkedIn.
3. Networking:
   - Connect with startups in Pune such as FlytBase, Lalit Startup, SoftTech, Saltmine, and BoM Startups.
   - Engage in the R&D agriculture project at COEP in collaboration with Erasmus.

## Projects
- Develop floor plan detection models.
- Explore midcurve neural networks.
- Work on COEP Erasmus agriculture projects.
- Develop OCR solutions for Sanskrit manuscripts using Sharada script.

This strategic move aims to leverage emerging opportunities in image processing while building a solid foundation for future innovations in 2D-3D Image/Geometric Modeling
