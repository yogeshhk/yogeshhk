## Introduction

This project aims to develop a product for floor plan segmentation using AI, machine learning, and computer vision techniques. The goal is to create a micro SaaS solution that caters to the real estate, architecture, and interior design industries.

Goal: Convert floor-plan image into data model

## AI-ML-CV Approaches
- Image-- Edge Detection-> Vector (SVG) -- Feature Recognition -> Brep => RAG/Fine-Tuning
	- [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
	- PyTorch, EdgeGAN
	- TinyML deployment
	
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - U-Net architecture
  - Mask R-CNN architecture
- Instance Segmentation
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
