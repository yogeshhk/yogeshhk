# AI Advisory/Consultancy

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries at an unusual pace. However, navigating the complexities of AI adoption and integration requires expert guidance. With a solid understanding of AI-related technologies and years of hands-on experience, I help organizations unlock their full potential in the AI domain by offering relevant and actionable advice.

## Engagement Approach

### üåê Scope of Work
I provide strategic advice and act as a sounding board for your AI initiatives. My role does not involve coding, implementation, or delivery responsibilities. You can engage with me either in person (in Pune) or through online consultations.

### üíª Expertise Domains
My familiarity spans multiple domains, including Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI.

### üìç Team Requirements
To ensure effective collaboration, your organization should have an in-house Data Science team capable of executing AI projects. I will participate in design discussions and help track progress. It is acceptable (and even preferable) if I do not have access to your proprietary codebase or knowledge base.
