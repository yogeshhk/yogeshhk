# Sadrushya (सादृश्य)

**Sadrushya** (सादृश्य, meaning *similar to the scene*) is an open-source initiative at the intersection of **Physical AI** and **3D Scene Understanding**. Our goal is to build tools, libraries, and applications that empower developers, researchers, and creators to generate, manipulate, and interact with 3D scenes using cutting-edge AI, ML, and generative technologies.

---

## 🚀 Main Theme

- **Physical AI for 3D environments**  
- Deep integration of **OpenUSD** workflows with AI models  
- Tools for **scene creation**, **manipulation**, **description**, and **fine-tuning**  
- Focus on **Generative AI**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, and **chatbots/copilots** for 3D data

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build open-source tools and libraries that help create and manipulate 3D scenes with AI assistance  
- Provide solutions for scene description, semantic understanding, and automated workflows  
- Enable fine-tuning models on OpenUSD data and documentation  
- Create chatbots and copilots that assist developers in scene modeling and editing  
- Drive innovation where 3D and AI converge, with a focus on generative capabilities

## 📂 Projects

- **Agents for OpenUSD workflows** – Smart assistants that automate scene-related tasks  
- **RAG with OpenUSD documentation** – Contextual retrieval systems to enhance developer experience  
- **Fine-tuning OpenUSD code generation** – Customizing AI models for USD file manipulation  
- **ChatUSF: Text-to-USD Copilot** – Interactive tools for modeling scenes from textual input

## 💡 Why Sadrushya?

- **Unique Expertise**: Combining AI with 3D modeling is a rare specialization (Specific Knowledge as inspired by Naval Ravikant) and a perfect IKIGAI   
- **OpenUSD Mastery**: We bring deep domain knowledge of USD workflows, standards, and ecosystem  
- **Strategic Positioning**: Focused on areas with genuine technical depth, not saturated markets like general-purpose LLMs  
- **Monetization Potential**: NVIDIA ecosystem certifications and domain-specific applications present significant opportunities  

---

## ❌ What This Is Not

- Not an edge AI or embedded systems project (e.g., Arduino tutorials)  
- Not a generic LLM project chasing public datasets without real monetization potential  
- Not focusing on Indic LLMs aimed purely at public good without scalable industry applications

## 🛠 How We Build ('LAO' Stack)

- **LangGraph** – Automating complex workflows for AI-driven interactions  
- **Agno** – AI agents framework for scene-based tasks  
- **OpenUSD** – Our core domain for 3D data, interoperability, and content modeling  

> **LAO** means *elder* or *big* in Chinese and *bring it on* in Hindi, representing expertise and readiness.
