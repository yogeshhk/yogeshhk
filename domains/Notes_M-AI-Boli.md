## Maiboli: Generative AI for Indic Languages (Marathi-centric)

### **Concept Summary**

- **Maiboli**:
    - *m* = Marathi
    - *ai* = Artificial Intelligence
    - *boli* = Language (spoken/in practice)
- **Mission**: Democratize AI for the masses, especially in Indic languages, with a focus on Marathi.
- **IKIGAI**: Social impact via MicroSaaS—serving society, contributing to the nation, and creating sustainable earnings.

---

## **Objectives**

- Enable learning, coding, and sharing in Indic languages.
- Develop and fine-tune/retrieve-augment (RAG) Indic Small Language Models (SLMs).
- Establish proprietary evaluation benchmarks for Indic SLMs.

---

## **Key Projects**

- **Yogasutra Sanskrit Graph**
    - Build knowledge graphs from Sanskrit Yogasutra texts for semantic search and reasoning.
- **GST Hindi \& Govt Docs**
    - Extract, process, and make accessible government documents (e.g., GST) in Hindi and other Indic languages.
- **BharatGen Dev Advocate**
    - Promote and support BharatGen (open-source Indic language models) adoption and community engagement.
- **Hackathon Problem Building**
    - Design and curate hackathon challenges focused on Indic NLP and AI applications.
- **Marathi Dataset Curation**
    - Identify, collect, and curate Marathi datasets (e.g., Navarasa) on platforms like Hugging Face, Kaggle, or AI Kosh.

## **Action Plan**

### **1. Community \& Ecosystem Building**

- Launch Maiboli as a MicroSaaS with clear social and commercial goals.
- Initiate outreach to Marathi/Indic language tech communities.
- Collaborate with BharatGen and similar open-source projects.


### **2. Data \& Benchmark Development**

- Audit existing Marathi/Indic datasets on Hugging Face, Kaggle, AI Kosh.
- Curate and release new high-quality datasets (e.g., Navarasa-style).
- Define and publish evaluation benchmarks for Indic SLMs.


### **3. Model Development**

- Fine-tune or RAG existing Indic SLMs with curated datasets.
- Open-source models and evaluation scripts for community use.


### **4. Project Execution**

- Build Yogasutra Sanskrit knowledge graphs; publish as open data.
- Digitize and process Hindi GST/government docs for NLP tasks.
- Organize and lead hackathons with real-world Indic AI challenges.


### **5. Advocacy \& Knowledge Sharing**

- Serve as BharatGen development advocate: tutorials, talks, guides.
- Regularly publish blog posts, code, and learnings.
- Encourage user-generated content: code, datasets, and benchmarks.
