## **About Me**

I’m an AI advisor based in Pune, India, with expertise in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Generative AI. I help organizations design and refine their AI solutions and strategies, offering technical guidance that focuses on turning AI potential into practical, measurable outcomes.

A key focus area for me is **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**—essentially building ChatGPT-like systems that answer questions using private data. My work spans complex documents, multimodal inputs, semantic chunking, evaluation metrics, production considerations, and system design. I also work across related tasks such as combo queries, text-to-SQL, vision LLMs, small LMs, and converting user queries into tool calls or test cases. This niche has grown out of hands-on experience and continuous learning, and has become my core area of interest.

## **Background**

I have more than two decades of experience in computer-aided design (CAD) research and software development, grounded in an academic background in geometric modeling. I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering** and a **PhD in Geometric Modeling** from the College of Engineering Pune (CoEP), as well as an **MS in Mechanical Engineering** from Kansas State University, USA.

My professional journey includes roles such as:

* **Principal Architect (CTO Office)** at Icertis
* **Software Development Manager** at Autodesk
* Advanced engineering roles at **Siemens PLM** and **PTC**
* **Data Science Consultant & Instructor**
* **Doctoral Scholar & Instructor** at CoEP (CAD/CAM, computational geometry)

In recent years, my work has transitioned fully into **AI/ML and NLP**, building on a strong technical and research foundation.
