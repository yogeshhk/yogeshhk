# TriMaya (3D Verse)

Welcome to TriMaya, a repository dedicated to the fusion of 3D geometric modeling, visualization, simulation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The name `TriMaya` stems from the combination of `Tri` meaning 3 in Sanskrit, representing the realm of 3D, geometric modeling, and more, while `Maya` meaning 'illusion' in Sanskrit, symbolizes AI-based-verse, virtual worlds, simulations, and the burgeoning metaverse. Together, they encapsulate three aspects of `Maya`: illusion, money, and love-care.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to encompass various aspects of 3D geometric deep learning, visualization, simulation, and artificial intelligence for 3D objects. Here's a brief overview of the main components:

- **src**: Contains implementations of algorithms and models for 3D geometric deep learning, AI, and simulations.
- **src/data**: Reserved for datasets relevant to 3D geometric deep learning tasks.
- **References**: Stores documentation, tutorials, and guides on how to use the codebase.
