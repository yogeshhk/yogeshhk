# Gen AI Consultancy Exploratory Checklist

Discuss to gather following information:

### 🧠 **Project Scope & Goals**

* What are the immediate AI/ML project domains (next 6–12 months)?
* What longer-term AI opportunities or experiments are being considered?
* Any business KPIs or success metrics tied to these initiatives?

### 🗺️ **Roadmap & Prioritization**

* Do you have a 1-year AI roadmap? How fixed or flexible is it?
* Any prioritized use cases (e.g., chatbots, agents, automation, analytics)?
* What’s driving prioritization—cost savings, efficiency, customer experience, etc.?

### 👥 **Stakeholders & Teams**

* Who are the internal stakeholders (AI/ML teams, PMs, DevOps, IT, etc.)?
* Are there clear owners for each initiative or deliverable?
* Who’s responsible for governance, compliance, and risk management?

### 🔍 **Expectations & Reality Check**

* Are you aware that GenAI is immature for mission-critical or non-text/image domains?
* Are current expectations aligned with realistic delivery (e.g., chatbots, co-pilots, basic agents only)?
* Is there awareness that LLM quality > agent design in most use cases?

### ⚠️ **Tech Constraints & Risks**

* Are you using or planning to use wrapper apps or black-box tools? (Risks: vendor lock-in, no debuggability)
* What’s your stance on open source vs. proprietary APIs (cost, control, performance)?
* Is there a plan to monitor model drift, data quality, and feedback loops?
* Is ML pipeline + human-in-loop (HITL) in place or being considered?

### ☁️ **Infra, Cloud, and Scale**

* Are workloads expected to run on cloud, hybrid, or on-prem?
* Do you have DevOps/MLOps maturity for scaling and productionizing?
* How is security, observability, and compliance handled in production workflows?

### 📈 **Data & Foundation Models**

* Do you have clean, labeled data for fine-tuning or evaluation?
* Any existing foundation models or vendors in use?
* Are you planning on building custom models or using off-the-shelf?

### 🧩 **Integration & Tooling**

* What is your existing tech stack (data, APIs, CI/CD, monitoring)?
* Any plans for agent orchestration or chaining tools (LangChain, Haystack, etc.)?
* Preferred frameworks, languages, or platforms?
