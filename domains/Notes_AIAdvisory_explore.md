# Gen AI Consultancy Exploratory Call Agenda

Discuss to gather following information:

### üß† **Project Scope & Goals**

* What are the immediate AI/ML project domains (next 6‚Äì12 months)?
* What longer-term AI opportunities or experiments are being considered?
* Any business KPIs or success metrics tied to these initiatives?

### üó∫Ô∏è **Roadmap & Prioritization**

* Do you have a 1-year AI roadmap? How fixed or flexible is it?
* Any prioritized use cases (e.g., chatbots, agents, automation, analytics)?
* What‚Äôs driving prioritization‚Äîcost savings, efficiency, customer experience, etc.?

### üë• **Stakeholders & Teams**

* Is there awareness that LLM quality > agent design in most use cases?

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tech Constraints & Risks**

* Are you using or planning to use wrapper apps or black-box tools? (Risks: vendor lock-in, no debuggability)
