# AI Recruitment Support

Hiring for AI-related roles demands more than traditional recruitment, it requires a decent understanding of the technology, the ecosystem, and the subtle signals that differentiate promising candidates from average ones. Our AI Recruitment Support vertical bridges this gap by combining **domain expertise** with **structured evaluation**.

## 🔒 Procedural Guardrails

To ensure transparency and prevent disputes over candidate origination:

1. **Timestamped Candidate Submissions:**
   Every candidate we refer will be shared via timestamped email (or shared applicant tracker). This establishes our claim as the referring source.

2. **Candidate Consent Declaration:**
   All referred candidates sign a short declaration confirming our involvement in their application process.

3. **Unique ID Tracking:**
   Each profile we forward carries a unique candidate code that must be retained through your internal ATS (Applicant Tracking System) for traceability.

4. **Next Step Trigger Confirmation:**
   As soon as your team selects the candidate we screened, the Interview charge applies automatically, independent of final selection.

5. **Hiring Confirmation Clause:**
   In our agreement, an explicit clause clarifies that if a candidate we referred (with timestamped proof) is hired within **6 months** of submission, our success fee (half the monthly CTC) applies, even if rediscovered later via another channel.
